            <h2>What is Reactex® technology?</h2>
            <p>Reactex® is Serta’s exclusive cooling system that is made of of three layers of cooling technology. Each cooling layer has more cooling capacity than the previous layer, so heat is pulled away from your body and deeper into the product.</p>
            <p>Reactex® offers its revolutionary cooling technology by employing the rules of physics to manage energy flow to disperse heat activating sustained climate control technology. It then implements a body-activated thermal structure to pull excess heat from the surface. Reactex® also has the ability to recharge and regenerate its cooling capacity, which results in hours of cooling.</p>
